    <p>Typography plays a crucial role in food-related content, as it helps convey the mood, style, and message of a dish, restaurant, or food product. Here are some important points about typography in food design:</p>
<div id="hi"> Font Weight and Size
    Bold Fonts: Use bold fonts to emphasize important elements like dish names, prices, or special offers. They are also effective in logos to create a strong visual impact.
    Light Fonts: Light fonts can be delicate and sophisticated, often used for descriptions or smaller details, but should be balanced to ensure legibility.
    Large Sizes: Larger fonts grab attention and are perfect for headings, titles, or names of signature dishes.
    Small Sizes: Smaller fonts are great for more detailed descriptions, but ensure they are readable by keeping the spacing generous.</div>
